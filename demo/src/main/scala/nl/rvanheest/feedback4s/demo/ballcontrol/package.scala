/**
  * The BallControl demo shows how a feedback system is created and applied in a simple, reactive
  * setup. The system under control is the position of a ball. Given its current position it has
  * to move to the position indicated by the user. To do so, we take the difference between the
  * ''current position'' and the ''desired position''. Using a
  * [[http://rvanheest.github.io/Literature-Study-Feedback-Control/Controllers.html#pid-control PID-controller]]
  * this ''error'' in transformed in a new ''acceleration''. By integrating twice (''acceleration''
  * to ''velocity'' to ''position'') we get the ball's next position. Repeating this process using
  * a feedback system ultimately brings the ball to a halt at the desired position.
